<p> A super great resource for functional analysis are <a  href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSpInro6Ys2IHve6oN9h005zmwfLnOSp1">these videos by John Cagnol</a>, 
    with what I believe are all the <a  href="http://cours.etudes.ecp.fr/claroline/document/goto/index.php/Analyse_Fonctionnelle/POLY-du-cours/Poly-AF-2019.pdf?cidReq=MA3100">course notes.</a>
