  <h2> Linear Algebra Basics </h2>
Definitions
  <p> A vector gives a direction and magnitude. A <b> linear combination </b> is multiplying some real coefficient in R by a set of vectors
    to get some combination of the set. A <b> span </b> is all possible linear combinations of a set of vectors.
  </p>
  <p> If you have a set of vectors {v1, v2, ...}, none of which are linear combinations of each other, they are <b> linearly independent </b>. 
    If you can write on vector as a multiple of another vector, the set is linearly dependent.
  </p>
  <p> Example 1: If you have vectors v1, v2: { [3  -2], [5  4] }, one linear combination is </p>
  <p> 2V1 + 3V2 = 2[3  -2] + 3[5  3] = [6  -4] + [15  9] = [21  5] </p> 
  which can be graphed. When you graph all possible linear combinations, you have the span.
  <p> Example 2: {[2  3], [4  6] is linearly dependent, but {[2  3], [1  0]} is not. </p>
  <p> If you wan to show that any vector in, say R^2, can be represented as your set of vectors, you would set [x y] 
    = {your set of vectors * coefficients}. Then you would know whether or not your set spans R^2. </p>
  <p> {v} is a subspace of R^n if (1) v contains the 0 vector, (2) if x is in {v}, cx is in {v} (closure under scalar
    multiplication and (3) if x and y in {v}, then x + y in {v} (closure under addition). </p>
  <p> Span of any set of vectors is a valid subspace (try proving) </p>
  <p> The basis of a subspace {v} is the set of vectors that span {v} and that are linearly independent. This is the minimum
    vectors you need to span the subspace {v}. </p>

  <h3> Questions </h3>
  <p> How can you tell if vectors span R^n by their graph? If they're showing different directions? </p>
  I found a great way: Imagine the vecotrs {[-1  -1], [1  1]}. Connect the tips of the vectors and turn that segment you're
  imagining into a line (extened both ends to infinitiy). Now fix the line to the tip of one of the vectors, say [-1 1].
  Now imagine the vector scaling down to 0 (like becoming a point). As you move [-1 1] to the origin, because the line is 
  fixed to it, imagine the line following it. It would only be moving in the y = x direction, so the line isn't really 
  changing. Thus, the vectors {[-1  -1], [1 1]} don't span R^2. If they did, they would cover the xy plane, not just be a line.
  <p> However, imagine {[3  0], [0  -2]}. Connect the tips of the vectors with a segment and make that segment a line (push 
    endpoints to infinity). Make the line fixed to the tip of v2 (or fixed to the point (0, -2)). Then shorten v2 by moving the
    tip up to the origin as the line is fixed to it: observe that the line moves across the xy plane, AKA spanning R^2!
  
  <p> What does linear independence and dependence mean geometrically? </p>
  <p> If two vectors are linearly dependent, they are on the same line (bc combination of each other), so either one spans the
    whole line. To be linearly indepened, all must make their own line. </p>
  <p> Now imagine 2 vectors in R^2 on the same plane. By above, they are independent and span that plane. If you add a third 
    vector on that plane, those 3 vectors are now dependent bc you can represent the third vector with the first two bc the first two
    span R^2. So to be independent, the third vector must be on a different plane. Now all 3 vectors span R^3. </p>
