  <h3> Dijkstras </h3>
  <p> Tries to find the shortest path between two nodes on a graph. </p>
  <p> Each edge has a cost for traveling it. When starting at node A, you have the cost of going to each node because of the 
    cost for each edge. You go to the edge with the least cost and record what the cost is. Then, from the second node, you 
    find the cost of all of the other edge options you currently have and again go the route with the least cost. Add it to 
    the first cost. </p>
  <p> Keep going until you reach the node you want to end at. </p>

  <h3> Proof of Infinite Primes </h3>
  <h4> as told by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctC33JAV4FI">Numberphile</a> </h4>
  Proof by contradiction. Suppose there is a finite list of primes p1, p2, ... pn. And that there is a number Q such that Q is the
  product of these primes + 1 (Q = p1 p2 ... pn + 1). We know that all numbers are products of primes (and can be expressed
  uniquely by a product of primes). Q cannot be written as a product of primes from only our list. Then the list is not complete.
  You cannot have a complete list.
